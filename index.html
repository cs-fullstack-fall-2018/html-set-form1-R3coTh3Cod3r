KEY: Where are my comments?! Please get in the habit of including at least one comment at the top of every submission saying what the code is doing. Can be brief, but needs to be there :-) 

KEY: Overall though, really nice job man as this was a tough exercise. I think you did the best at following the instructions.

See my notes inline. Keep up the great effort!

        For radio buttons to work as a same group, give them all the same name so only one can
        be selected. They can still have/submit different 'values'
